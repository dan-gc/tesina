@article{grunbaum,
	abstract = {Although it is customary to define polygons as certain families of edges, when considering polyhedra it is usual to view polygons as 2-dimensional pieces of the plane. If this rather illogical point of view is replaced by consistently understanding polygons as 1-dimensional complexes, the theory of polyhedra becomes richer and more satisfactory. Even with the strictest definition of regularity this approach leads to 17 individual regular polyhedra in the Euclidean 3-space and 12 infinite families of such polyhedra, besides the traditional ones (which consist of 5 Platonic polyhedra, 4 Kepler---Poinsot polyhedra, 3 planar tessellations and 3 Petrie---Coxeter polyhedra). Among the many still open problems that naturally arise from the new point of view, the most obvious one is the question whether the regular polyhedra found in the paper are the only ones possible in the Euclidean 3-space.},

However, the methods employed here are in the same spirit as those used in the description of all three-dimensional regular polytopes by this author and Schulte, and the regular polytopes of full rank by this author.  The procedure has two stages.  First, the possible dimension vectors (dim R0,dim R1,dim R2) of the mirrors R0,R1,R2 of the generating reflexions of the symmetry groups are determined.  Second, all polyhedra with a given dimension vector are found.  Most of the polyhedra are related to four-dimensional Coxeter groups, although one class has to be approached using quaternions.},
